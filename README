hangwithme

Road Map
Iteration One (completed):
 - Single Player
 - Randomly generated word
 - No Hangman image (only number of guesses left)

Iteration Two (completed):
 - Two player mode - both players race to guess random word

Iteration Three (in progress):
 - HTML5 hangman image that updates with incorrect guesses

Other Ideas:
 - Difficulty modes (choose from different dictionaries?)
 - Leaderboard (would require persisted players and games, and login; should still allow anonymous play, maybe prompt for register at the end)
 - Mobile compatibility
